Detailed Description
--------------------



This component implements a stub that behaves like a real visuhandler. The difference is that it communicates with a CmpTargetvisuStub via Inter process communication. You can include this component when you want to build a system for a targetvisualization where the targetvisualization lives in an own process. In this case integrate this component into the runtime system where the targetvisu is, ie. in normal cases the part of the runtime system that runs in usermode.
